NAME
	br - bashreduce, map/reduce in bash

SYNOPSIS
	br --hosts|-h '<host>[ <host>][...]' [--column|-c <column>]
		[--map|-m <map>] [--reduce|-r <reduce>] [--mirror|-M]
		[--input|-i <input>] [--output <output>]
		[--tmp <tmp>] [-S <sort-mem-MB>] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
	br implements a map/reduce framework that allows the map and reduce
	jobs to be constructed from standard Unix tools.  It can operate on
	data piped into it or on files known to exist on the worker nodes.

INSTALLATION
	br can run out-of-the box but for convenience, put it somewhere on
	your PATH.  The brutils come with a Makefile that will install
	these tools, probably to /usr/local/bin.  If you leave these tools
	in place relative to br, they'll be picked up and used from there.

	You'll need passwordless ssh access to each machine you wish to
	use as a worker (even localhost, for now).

OPTIONS
	--hosts, -h
		The list of hosts to be used, specified as a space-
		delimited list.  Specifying the same host multiple
		times is allowed and is useful for taking explicit
		advantage of multiple cores.

	--column, -c

	--map, -m
		The map program, which should expect data on stdin
		and produce the intermediate data on stdout.  The
		stderr from this program will be logged.

	--reduce, -r
		The reduce program, which should expect data on stdin
		and produce the intermediate data on stdout.  The
		stderr from this program will be logged.

	--mirror, -M
		Only pass filenames from the master to the workers,
		under the assumption that they all have a mirror of
		the data set.

	--input, -i
		A file or directory to serve as input.  If it is a
		file, this is equivalent to piping that file into
		br.  If it is a directory, it is equivalent to
		piping the names of every file in that directory
		into br.

	--output, -o
		The local file where output will be stored.
		Defaults to stdout.

	--tmp, -t
		The temporary directory for storing br files.  All of
		these files will be prefixed with "br_" and will be
		cleaned up upon successful exit.

	-S
		This is directly the -S option from sort(1).  It defaults
		to 256M.

	--help
		Shows a help message and details about the arguments.
